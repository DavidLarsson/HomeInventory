# HomeInventory

WIP

The easiest way to use this is to run nix-shell in the root folder of the project. This will setup all the dependencies you need and a virtual Python environment.

Currently only the learning folder contains anything that is even remotely useful: run
```
export FLASK_APP=flask_1.py
flask run
```
in that folder to get a Fibonacci calculator @ 127.0.0.1:5000.
